# Smart Version Control Simulator (Java)

## 📌 Project Purpose
This project is a simplified simulation of a version control system built using Java.
It demonstrates how core Data Structures and Object-Oriented Programming concepts
can be used to design real-world systems like Git at a basic level.

The goal of this project is to strengthen fundamentals in Java, DSA, and system thinking,
while building a resume-worthy project suitable for software engineering internships.

## 🛠️ Features
- Add new versions (commits)
- Undo the last version (rollback)
- Retrieve a specific version by ID
- View complete version history
- Handles edge cases like invalid inputs and empty undo operations

---

## 🧠 Data Structures Used
- **ArrayList** → Maintain ordered version history
- **HashMap** → O(1) retrieval of versions by ID
- **Stack** → Undo / rollback functionality (LIFO)

---

## 🧩 Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Classes)
- Java Collections Framework
- Stack-based undo logic
- HashMap-based efficient lookup
- Input validation & edge case handling
- Clean code and separation of concerns

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
3. Run `Main.java`
4. Use the console menu to interact with the system
